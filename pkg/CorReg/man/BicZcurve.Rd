\title{Curve of the BIC for each possible p2 with a fixed Z and truncature of Z}
\usage{
BicZcurve(X = X, Z = Z, Bic_null_vect = Bic_null_vect, plot = T,
  star = F, trunc = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{matrix containing the dataset}

\item{Z}{adjacency matrix (binary) describing the structure between the variables}

\item{Bic_null_vect}{vector of the BIC for each variable. used when the variable is independant}

\item{plot}{boolean to plot or not the curve}

\item{star}{boolean to use BIC* (hierarchical uniform law on the structure)}

\item{trunc}{number of sub-regression to keep (best R2). if NULL the min of BIC is kept}
}
