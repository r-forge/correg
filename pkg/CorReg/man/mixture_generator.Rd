\arguments{
\item{n}{the number of individuals in the learning dataset}

\item{p}{the number of covariates (without the response)}

\item{ratio}{the ratio of explained covariates (dependent)}

\item{max_compl}{the number of covariates in each subregression}

\item{valid}{the size of the validation sample}

\item{positive}{the ratio of positive coefficients in both the regression and the subregressions}

\item{sigma_Y}{standard deviation for the noise of the regression}

\item{sigma_X}{standard deviation for the noise of the subregression (all). ignored if gamma=T or if R2 is not NULL}

\item{R2}{the strength of the subregressions}

\item{R2Y}{the strength of the main regression}

\item{meanvar}{vector of means for the covariates.}

\item{sigmavar}{standard deviation of the covariates.}

\item{lambda}{paramater of the law that define the number of components in gaussian mixture models}

\item{Amax}{the maximum number of covariates with non-zero coefficients in the regression}

\item{lambdapois}{parameter used to generate the coefficient in the subregressions. poisson distribution.}

\item{gamma}{boolean to generate a p-sized vector sigma_X gamma-distributed}

\item{gammashape}{shape parameter of the gamma distribution (if needed)}

\item{gammascale}{scale parameter of the gamma distribution (if needed)}

\item{tp1}{the ratio of right-side covariates allowed to have a non-zero coefficient in the regression}

\item{tp2}{the ratio of left-side covariates allowed to have a non-zero coefficient in the regression}

\item{tp3}{the ratio of strictly independent covariates allowed to have a non-zero coefficient in the regression}

\item{pb}{generates Y in an heuristic way that will give some issues with correlations.}

\item{nonlin}{to use non linear structure (half squared , half log). if not null, it is the proba to use power pnonlin instead of log}

\item{pnonlin}{the power used if non linear structure}

\item{scale}{boolean to scale X before computing Y}

\item{Z}{the adjacency matrix to obtain}
