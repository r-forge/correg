\arguments{
  \item{n}{the number of individuals in the learning
  dataset}

  \item{p}{the number of covariates (without the response)}

  \item{ratio}{the ratio of explained covariates
  (dependent)}

  \item{max_compl}{the number of covariates in each
  subregression}

  \item{valid}{the size of the validation sample}

  \item{positive}{the ratio of positive coefficients in
  both the regression and the subregressions}

  \item{sigma_Y}{standard deviation for the noise of the
  regression}

  \item{sigma_X}{standard deviation for the noise of the
  subregression (all). ignored if gamma=T}

  \item{gamma}{boolean to generate a p-sized vector sigma_X
  gamma-distributed}

  \item{gammashape}{shape parameter of the gamma
  distribution (if needed)}

  \item{gammascale}{scale parameter of the gamma
  distribution (if needed)}

  \item{meanvar}{vector of means for the covariates.}

  \item{sigmavar}{standard deviation of the covariates.}

  \item{lambda}{paramater of the law that define the number
  of components in gaussian mixture models}

  \item{Amax}{the maximum number of covariates with
  non-zero coefficients in the regression}

  \item{tp1}{the ratio of right-side covariates allowed to
  have a non-zero coefficient in the regression}

  \item{tp2}{the ratio of left-side covariates allowed to
  have a non-zero coefficient in the regression}

  \item{tp3}{the ratio of strictly independent covariates
  allowed to have a non-zero coefficient in the regression}

  \item{lambdapois}{parameter used to generate the
  coefficient in the subregressions. poisson distribution.}

  \item{pb}{generates Y in an heuristic way that will give
  some issues with correlations.}

  \item{nonlin}{to use non linear structure (half squared ,
  half log). if not null, it is the proba to use power
  pnonlin instead of log}

  \item{pnonlin}{the power used if non linear structure}

  \item{scale}{boolean to scale X before computing Y}
